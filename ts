API Gateway (REST API): Serves as the entry point for clients to access your application. It will handle client requests and can also be configured to log request and response data.
ECS Cluster: Hosts your application in Docker containers, allowing it to scale and manage traffic efficiently.
Load Balancer (ALB or NLB): Distributes incoming traffic across multiple targets, such as ECS service instances, to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.
CloudWatch Logs: Collects logs from various AWS resources, including API Gateway and ECS. You can set up logging at different levels (e.g., error logs, access logs) for detailed monitoring and troubleshooting.
VPC Link: Connects API Gateway to other AWS services within a VPC, enabling secure and private communication.
Route 53: Manages DNS for the applicationâ€™s URL, directing client requests to the API Gateway.
IAM Roles and Policies: Ensures secure access control to AWS resources and services.
